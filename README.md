# CS250FinalProject
To implement user needs you take what users talk about and implement what you see recurring and what will benefite the program. In the example of the SNHU travels project you could see that users often talked about wanting to see top listed trips tailored to them. This allows you tee see how it is priorties by users to have trips theyll like and implement more features that do this. It also help priotize it since lots of people wanted it.
The best agile process I would use is the review aspect. Looking back at old work and see how you can do something better is very benifical when moving forward. It shows where you can improve and maybe you can make something you commonly do more effecient.
To be a good team member in software development is to listen to critiques and have open communication with the rest of the team. Someone on the team might know how to do something better and can help make your work more efficent and the same is true the other way. It is also important to share when you are struggling with something. Rather than hold the team back and try and solve everything yourrself it can help to ask for help so you can better understand and get help with what is making you struggle.
